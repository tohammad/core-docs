# How to: Stream XML Fragments from an XmlReader (Visual Basic)
When you have to process large XML files, it might not be feasible to load the whole XML tree into memory. This topic shows how to stream fragments using an <xref:System.Xml.XmlReader>.  
  
 One of the most effective ways to use an <xref:System.Xml.XmlReader> to read <xref:System.Xml.Linq.XElement> objects is to write your own custom axis method. An axis method typically returns a collection such as <xref:System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable`1> of <xref:System.Xml.Linq.XElement>, as shown in the example in this topic. In the custom axis method, after you create the XML fragment by calling the <xref:System.Xml.Linq.XNode.ReadFrom*> method, return the collection using `yield return`. This provides deferred execution semantics to your custom axis method.  
  
 When you create an XML tree from an <xref:System.Xml.XmlReader> object, the <xref:System.Xml.XmlReader> must be positioned on an element. The <xref:System.Xml.Linq.XNode.ReadFrom*> method does not return until it has read the close tag of the element.  
  
 If you want to create a partial tree, you can instantiate an <xref:System.Xml.XmlReader>, position the reader on the node that you want to convert to an <xref:System.Xml.Linq.XElement> tree, and then create the <xref:System.Xml.Linq.XElement> object.  
  
 The topic [How to: Stream XML Fragments with Access to Header Information (Visual Basic)](../../../../visual-basic\programming-guide\concepts\linq/how-to-stream-xml-fragments-with-access-to-header-information.md) contains information and an example on how to stream a more complex document.  
  
 The topic [How to: Perform Streaming Transform of Large XML Documents (Visual Basic)](../../../../visual-basic\programming-guide\concepts\linq/how-to-perform-streaming-transform-of-large-xml-documents.md) contains an example of using LINQ to XML to transform extremely large XML documents while maintaining a small memory footprint.  
  
## Example  
 This example creates a custom axis method. You can query it by using a [!INCLUDE[vbteclinq](../../../../csharp/includes/vbteclinq_md.md)] query. The custom axis method, `StreamRootChildDoc`, is a method that is designed specifically to read a document that has a repeating `Child` element.  
  
<CodeContentPlaceHolder>0</CodeContentPlaceHolder>  
 This example produces the following output:  
  
<CodeContentPlaceHolder>1</CodeContentPlaceHolder>  
 In this example, the source document is very small. However, even if there were millions of `Child` elements, this example would still have a small memory footprint.
