# Variance in Generic Interfaces (Visual Basic)
.NET Framework 4 introduced variance support for several existing generic interfaces. Variance support enables implicit conversion of classes that implement these interfaces. The following interfaces are now variant:  
  
-   <xref:System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable`1> (T is covariant)  
  
-   <xref:System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerator`1> (T is covariant)  
  
-   <xref:System.Linq.IQueryable`1> (T is covariant)  
  
-   <xref:System.Linq.IGrouping`2> (`TKey` and `TElement` are covariant)  
  
-   <xref:System.Collections.Generic.IComparer`1> (T is contravariant)  
  
-   <xref:System.Collections.Generic.IEqualityComparer`1> (T is contravariant)  
  
-   <xref:System.IComparable`1> (T is contravariant)  
  
 Covariance permits a method to have a more derived return type than that defined by the generic type parameter of the interface. To illustrate the covariance feature, consider these generic interfaces: `IEnumerable(Of Object)` and `IEnumerable(Of String)`. The `IEnumerable(Of String)` interface does not inherit the `IEnumerable(Of Object)` interface. However, the `String` type does inherit the `Object` type, and in some cases you may want to assign objects of these interfaces to each other. This is shown in the following code example.  
  
<CodeContentPlaceHolder>0</CodeContentPlaceHolder>  
 In earlier versions of the .NET Framework, this code causes a compilation error in Visual Basic with `Option Strict On`. But now you can use `strings` instead of `objects`, as shown in the previous example, because the <xref:System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable`1> interface is covariant.  
  
 Contravariance permits a method to have argument types that are less derived than that specified by the generic parameter of the interface. To illustrate contravariance, assume that you have created a `BaseComparer` class to compare instances of the `BaseClass` class. The `BaseComparer` class implements the `IEqualityComparer(Of BaseClass)` interface. Because the <xref:System.Collections.Generic.IEqualityComparer`1> interface is now contravariant, you can use `BaseComparer` to compare instances of classes that inherit the `BaseClass` class. This is shown in the following code example.  
  
<CodeContentPlaceHolder>1</CodeContentPlaceHolder>  
 For more examples, see [Using Variance in Interfaces for Generic Collections (Visual Basic)](../../../../visual-basic\programming-guide\concepts\covariance-contravariance/using-variance-in-interfaces-for-generic-collections.md).  
  
 Variance in generic interfaces is supported for reference types only. Value types do not support variance. For example, `IEnumerable(Of Integer)` cannot be implicitly converted to `IEnumerable(Of Object)`, because integers are represented by a value type.  
  
<CodeContentPlaceHolder>2</CodeContentPlaceHolder>  
 It is also important to remember that classes that implement variant interfaces are still invariant. For example, although <xref:System.Collections.Generic.List`1> implements the covariant interface <xref:System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable`1>, you cannot implicitly convert `List(Of Object)` to `List(Of String)`. This is illustrated in the following code example.  
  
```vb  
' The following statement generates a compiler error  
' because classes are invariant.  
' Dim list As List(Of Object) = New List(Of String)  
  
' You can use the interface object instead.  
Dim listObjects As IEnumerable(Of Object) = New List(Of String)  
```
