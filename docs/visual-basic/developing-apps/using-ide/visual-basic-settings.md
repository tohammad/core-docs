# Visual Basic Settings
Visual Basic settings are designed to optimize the user experience and to maximize the productivity of Visual Basic developers. It is part of the [Customizing Development Settings in Visual Studio](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/22c4debb-4e31-47a8-8f19-16f328d7dcd3) feature, which enables you to customize and save your settings in the Visual Studio Integrated Development Environment (IDE).  
  
 You can also port or reload your IDE settings on other computers. For more information, see [How to: Share Settings Between Computers](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/1131fb10-35c1-42da-9cd8-91aa3235b882).
