# /keycontainer
Specifies a key container name for a key pair to give an assembly a strong name.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
/keycontainer:container  
```  
  
## Arguments  
  
|||  
|-|-|  
|Term|Definition|  
|`container`|Required. Container file that contains the key. Enclose the file name in quotation marks ("") if the name contains a space.|  
  
## Remarks  
 The compiler creates the sharable component by inserting a public key into the assembly manifest and by signing the final assembly with the private key. To generate a key file, type `sn -k``file` at the command line. The `-i` option installs the key pair into a container. For more information, see [Sn.exe (Strong Name Tool)](../Topic/Sn.exe%20\(Strong%20Name%20Tool\).md).  
  
 If you compile with `/target:module`, the name of the key file is held in the module and incorporated into the assembly that is created when you compile an assembly with [/addmodule](../../../visual-basic\reference\command-line-compiler/addmodule.md).  
  
 You can also specify this option as a custom attribute (<xref:System.Reflection.AssemblyKeyNameAttribute>) in the source code for any Microsoft intermediate language (MSIL) module.  
  
 You can also pass your encryption information to the compiler with [/keyfile](../../../visual-basic\reference\command-line-compiler/keyfile.md). Use [/delaysign](../../../visual-basic\reference\command-line-compiler/delaysign.md) if you want a partially signed assembly.  
  
 See [Creating and Using Strong-Named Assemblies](../Topic/Creating%20and%20Using%20Strong-Named%20Assemblies.md) for more information on signing an assembly.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  The `/keycontainer` option is not available from within the Visual Studio development environment; it is available only when compiling from the command line.  
  
## Example  
 The following code compiles source file `Input.vb` and specifies a key container.  
  
```  
vbc /keycontainer:key1 input.vb  
```
