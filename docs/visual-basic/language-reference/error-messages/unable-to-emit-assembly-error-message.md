# Unable to emit assembly: &lt;error message&gt;
The [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../../../csharp\programming-guide\concepts\linq/includes/vbprvb_md.md)] compiler calls the Assembly Linker (Al.exe, also known as Alink) to generate an assembly with a manifest, with the linker reporting an error in the emission stage of creating the assembly.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30145  
  
### To correct this error  
  
1.  Examine the quoted error message and consult the topic [Al.exe Tool Errors and Warnings](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/7f125d49-0a03-47a6-9ba9-d61a679a7d4b) for further explanation and advice.  
  
2.  Try signing the assembly manually, using either the [Al.exe (Assembly Linker)](../Topic/Al.exe%20\(Assembly%20Linker\).md) or the [Sn.exe (Strong Name Tool)](../Topic/Sn.exe%20\(Strong%20Name%20Tool\).md).  
  
3.  If the error persists, gather information about the circumstances and notify Microsoft Product Support Services.  
  
### To sign the assembly manually  
  
1.  Use the [Sn.exe (Strong Name Tool)](../Topic/Sn.exe%20\(Strong%20Name%20Tool\).md) to create a public/private key pair file.  
  
     This file has a .snk extension.  
  
2.  Delete the COM reference that is generating the error from your project.  
  
3.  From the Windows **Start** menu, point to **Programs**, point to **Microsoft Visual Studio 2008**, point to **Visual Studio Tools**, and then click **Visual Studio 2008 Command Prompt**.  
  
4.  Move to the directory where you want to place your assembly wrapper.  
  
5.  Type the following code.  
  
    ```  
    tlbimp <path to COM reference file> /out:<output assembly name> /keyfile:<path to .snk file>  
    ```  
  
     An example of the code you might enter would be the following.  
  
    ```  
    tlbimp c:\windows\system32\msi.dll /out:Interop.WindowsInstaller.dll /keyfile:"c:\documents and settings\mykey.snk"  
    ```  
  
     Use double quotation marks (") if a path or file contains spaces.  
  
6.  In [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../../csharp/includes/vsprvs_md.md)], add a .NET Assembly reference to the file you just created.
