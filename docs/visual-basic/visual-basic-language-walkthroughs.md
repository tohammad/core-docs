# Visual Basic Language Walkthroughs
Walkthroughs give step-by-step instructions for common scenarios, which makes them a good place to start learning about the product or a particular feature area.  
  
 [Writing an Async Program](../Topic/Walkthrough:%20Accessing%20the%20Web%20by%20Using%20Async%20and%20Await%20\(C%23%20and%20Visual%20Basic\).md)  
 Shows how to create an asynchronous solution by using [Async](../visual-basic\language-reference\modifiers/async.md) and [Await](../visual-basic\language-reference\operators/await-operator.md), which are introduced in [!INCLUDE[vs_dev11_long](../csharp/includes/vs_dev11_long_md.md)].  
  
 [Declaring and Raising Events](../visual-basic\programming-guide\language-features\events/walkthrough-declaring-and-raising-events.md)  
 Illustrates how events are declared and raised in [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../csharp\programming-guide\concepts\linq/includes/vbprvb_md.md)].  
  
 [Handling Events](../visual-basic\programming-guide\language-features\events/walkthrough-handling-events.md)  
 Shows how to handle events using either the standard `WithEvents` keyword or the new `AddHandler`/`RemoveHandler` keywords.  
  
 [Creating and Implementing Interfaces](../visual-basic\programming-guide\language-features\interfaces/walkthrough-creating-and-implementing-interfaces.md)  
 Shows how interfaces are declared and implemented in [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../csharp\programming-guide\concepts\linq/includes/vbprvb_md.md)].  
  
 [Defining Classes](../visual-basic\programming-guide\language-features\objects-and-classes/walkthrough-defining-classes.md)  
 Describes how to declare a class and its fields, properties, methods, and events.  
  
 [Writing Queries in Visual Basic](../visual-basic\programming-guide\concepts\linq/walkthrough-writing-queries.md)  
 Demonstrates how you can use Visual Basic language features to write [!INCLUDE[vbteclinqext](../csharp\getting-started/includes/vbteclinqext_md.md)] query expressions.  
  
 [Implementing IEnumerable(Of T) in Visual Basic](../visual-basic\programming-guide\language-features\control-flow/walkthrough-implementing-ienumerable-of-t.md)  
 Demonstrates how to create a class that implements the `IEnumerable(Of String)` interface and a class that implements the `IEnumerator(Of String)` interface to read a text file one line at a time.  
  
 [Calling Windows APIs](../visual-basic\programming-guide\com-interop/walkthrough-calling-windows-apis.md)  
 Explains how to use `Declare` statements and call Windows APIs. Includes information about using attributes to control marshaling for the API call and how to expose an API call as a method of a class.  
  
 [Creating COM Objects with Visual Basic](../visual-basic\programming-guide\com-interop/walkthrough-creating-com-objects.md)  
 Demonstrates how to create COM objects in [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../csharp\programming-guide\concepts\linq/includes/vbprvb_md.md)], both with and without the COM class template.  
  
 [Implementing Inheritance with COM Objects](../visual-basic\programming-guide\com-interop/walkthrough-implementing-inheritance-with-com-objects.md)  
 Demonstrates how to use [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../csharp\programming-guide\concepts\linq/includes/vbprvb_md.md)] 6.0 to create a COM object containing a class, and then use it as a base class in [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../csharp\programming-guide\concepts\linq/includes/vbprvb_md.md)].  
  
 [Multithreading](../Topic/Walkthrough:%20Multithreading%20with%20the%20BackgroundWorker%20Component%20\(C%23%20and%20Visual%20Basic\).md)  
 Shows how to create a multithreaded application that searches a text file for occurrences of a word.  
  
 [Determining Where My.Application.Log Writes Information](../visual-basic\developing-apps\programming\log-info/walkthrough-determining-where-my-application-log-writes-information.md)  
 Describes the default `My.Application.Log` settings and how to determine the settings for your application.  
  
 [Changing Where My.Application.Log Writes Information](../visual-basic\developing-apps\programming\log-info/walkthrough-changing-where-my-application-log-writes-information.md)  
 Shows how to override the default `My.Application.Log` and `My.Log` settings for logging event information and cause the `Log` object to write to other log listeners.  
  
 [Filtering My.Application.Log Output](../visual-basic\developing-apps\programming\log-info/walkthrough-filtering-my-application-log-output.md)  
 Demonstrates how to change the default log filtering for the `My.Application.Log` object.  
  
 [Creating Custom Log Listeners](../visual-basic\developing-apps\programming\log-info/walkthrough-creating-custom-log-listeners.md)  
 Demonstrates how to create a custom log listener and configure it to listen to the output of the `My.Application.Log` object.  
  
 [Embedding Types from Managed Assemblies](../Topic/Walkthrough:%20Embedding%20Types%20from%20Managed%20Assemblies%20\(C%23%20and%20Visual%20Basic\).md)  
 Describes how to create an assembly and a client program that embeds types from it.  
  
 [Validating That Passwords Are Complex (Visual Basic)](../visual-basic\programming-guide\language-features\strings/walkthrough-validating-that-passwords-are-complex.md)  
 Demonstrates how to check for strong-password characteristics and update a string parameter with information about which checks a password fails.
