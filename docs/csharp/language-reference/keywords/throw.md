# throw (C# Reference)
The `throw` statement is used to signal the occurrence of an anomalous situation (exception) during the program execution.  
  
## Remarks  
 The thrown exception is an object whose class is derived from <xref:System.Exception?displayProperty=fullName>, as shown in the following example.  
  
```  
class MyException : System.Exception {}  
// ...  
throw new MyException();  
```  
  
 Usually the `throw` statement is used with `try-catch` or `try-finally` statements.  A [throw](../../../csharp\language-reference\keywords/throw.md) statement can be used in a `catch` block to re-throw the exception that the `catch` block caught.  In this case, the [throw](../../../csharp\language-reference\keywords/throw.md) statement does not take an exception operand.  For more information and examples, see [try-catch](../../../csharp\language-reference\keywords/try-catch.md) and [How to: Explicitly Throw Exceptions](../Topic/How%20to:%20Explicitly%20Throw%20Exceptions.md).  
  
## Example  
 This example demonstrates how to throw an exception using the `throw` statement.
