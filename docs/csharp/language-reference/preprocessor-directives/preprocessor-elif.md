# #elif (C# Reference)
`#elif` lets you create a compound conditional directive. The `#elif` expression will be evaluated if neither the preceding [#if](../../../csharp\language-reference\preprocessor-directives/preprocessor-if.md) nor any preceding, optional, `#elif` directive expressions evaluate to `true`. If a `#elif` expression evaluates to `true`, the compiler evaluates all the code between the `#elif` and the next conditional directive. For example:  
  
```  
#define VC7  
//...  
#if debug  
    Console.Writeline("Debug build");  
#elif VC7  
    Console.Writeline("Visual Studio 7");  
#endif  
```  
  
 You can use the operators `==` (equality), `!=` (inequality), `&&` (and), and `||` (or), to evaluate multiple symbols. You can also group symbols and operators with parentheses.  
  
## Remarks  
 `#elif` is equivalent to using:  
  
```  
#else  
#if  
```  
  
 Using `#elif` is simpler, because each `#if` requires a [#endif](../../../csharp\language-reference\preprocessor-directives/preprocessor-endif.md), whereas a `#elif` can be used without a matching `#endif`.  
  
 See [#if](../../../csharp\language-reference\preprocessor-directives/preprocessor-if.md) for an example of how to use `#elif`.
