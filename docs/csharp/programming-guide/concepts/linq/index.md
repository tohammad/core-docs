# Language-Integrated Query (LINQ) (C#)
LINQ is a set of features that extends powerful query capabilities to the language syntax of C#. LINQ introduces standard, easily-learned patterns for querying and updating data, and the technology can be extended to support potentially any kind of data store.  The .NET Framework includes LINQ provider assemblies that enable the use of LINQ with .NET Framework collections, SQL Server databases, ADO.NET Datasets, and XML documents.  
  
## In This Section  
 [Introduction to LINQ (C#)](../../../../csharp\programming-guide\concepts\linq/introduction-to-linq.md)  
 Provides a general introduction to the kinds of applications that you can write and the kinds of problems that you can solve with LINQ queries.  
  
 [Getting Started with LINQ in C#](../../../../csharp\programming-guide\concepts\linq/getting-started-with-linq-in-csharp.md)  
 Describes the basic facts you should know in order to understand the C# documentation and samples.  
  
 [Visual Studio IDE and Tools Support for LINQ (C#)](../../../../csharp\programming-guide\concepts\linq/visual-studio-ide-and-tools-support-for-linq.md)  
 Describes Visual Studio's Object Relational Designer, debugger support for queries, and other IDE features related to LINQ.  
  
 [Standard Query Operators Overview (C#)](../../../../csharp\programming-guide\concepts\linq/standard-query-operators-overview.md)  
 Provides an introduction to the standard query operators. It also provides links to topics that have more information about each type of query operation.  
  
 [LINQ to Objects (C#)](../../../../csharp\programming-guide\concepts\linq/linq-to-objects.md)  
 Includes links to topics that explain how to use LINQ to Objects to access in-memory data structures,  
  
 [LINQ to XML (C#)](../../../../csharp\programming-guide\concepts\linq/linq-to-xml.md)  
 Includes links to topics that explain how to use LINQ to XML, which provides the in-memory document modification capabilities of the Document Object Model (DOM), and supports LINQ query expressions.  
  
 [LINQ to ADO.NET (Portal Page)](../../../../csharp\programming-guide\concepts\linq/linq-to-adonet-portal-page.md)  
 Provides an entry point for documentation about LINQ to DataSet, LINQ to SQL, and LINQ to Entities. LINQ to DataSet enables you to build richer query capabilities into <xref:System.Data.DataSet> by using the same query functionality that is available for other data sources. LINQ to SQL provides a run-time infrastructure for managing relational data as objects. LINQ to Entities enables developers to write queries against the Entity Framework conceptual model by using C#.  
  
 [Enabling a Data Source for LINQ Querying](../../../../csharp\programming-guide\concepts\linq/enabling-a-data-source-for-linq-querying1.md)  
 Provides an introduction to custom LINQ providers, LINQ expression trees, and other ways to extend LINQ.
