# LINQ Query Expressions (C# Programming Guide)
[!INCLUDE[vbteclinqext](../../../csharp\getting-started/includes/vbteclinqext_md.md)] is the name for a set of technologies based on the integration of query capabilities directly into the C# language (also in Visual Basic and potentially any other .NET language). With [!INCLUDE[vbteclinq](../../../csharp/includes/vbteclinq_md.md)], a query is now a first-class language construct, just like classes, methods, events and so on.  
  
 For a developer who writes queries, the most visible "language-integrated" part of [!INCLUDE[vbteclinq](../../../csharp/includes/vbteclinq_md.md)] is the query expression. Query expressions are written in a declarative *query syntax* introduced in C# 3.0. By using query syntax, you can perform even complex filtering, ordering, and grouping operations on data sources with a minimum of code. You use the same basic query expression patterns to query and transform data in SQL databases, [!INCLUDE[vstecado](../../../csharp\programming-guide\concepts\linq/includes/vstecado_md.md)] Datasets, XML documents and streams, and .NET collections.  
  
 The following example shows the complete query operation. The complete operation includes creating a data source, defining the query expression, and executing the query in a `foreach` statement.  
  
 [!code-cs[csProgGuideLINQ#11](../../../csharp\programming-guide\classes-and-structs/codesnippet/CSharp/index_1.cs)]  
  
 For more information about the basics of [!INCLUDE[vbteclinq](../../../csharp/includes/vbteclinq_md.md)] in C#, see [Getting Started with LINQ in C#](../../../csharp\programming-guide\concepts\linq/getting-started-with-linq-in-csharp.md).  
  
## Query Expression Overview  
  
-   Query expressions can be used to query and to transform data from any [!INCLUDE[vbteclinq](../../../csharp/includes/vbteclinq_md.md)]-enabled data source. For example, a single query can retrieve data from a SQL database, and produce an XML stream as output.  
  
-   Query expressions are easy to master because they use many familiar C# language constructs. For more information, see [Getting Started with LINQ in C#](../../../csharp\programming-guide\concepts\linq/getting-started-with-linq-in-csharp.md).  
  
-   The variables in a query expression are all strongly typed, although in many cases you do not have to provide the type explicitly because the compiler can infer it. For more information, see [Type Relationships in LINQ Query Operations](../../../csharp\programming-guide\concepts\linq/type-relationships-in-linq-query-operations.md).  
  
-   A query is not executed until you iterate over the query variable in a `foreach` statement. For more information, see [Introduction to LINQ Queries (C#)](../../../csharp\programming-guide\concepts\linq/introduction-to-linq-queries.md).  
  
-   At compile time, query expressions are converted to Standard Query Operator method calls according to the rules set forth in the C# specification. Any query that can be expressed by using query syntax can also be expressed by using method syntax. However, in most cases query syntax is more readable and concise. For more information, see [C# Language Specification](../../../csharp\language-reference/csharp-language-specification.md) and [Standard Query Operators Overview](../Topic/Standard%20Query%20Operators%20Overview.md).  
  
-   As a rule when you write [!INCLUDE[vbteclinq](../../../csharp/includes/vbteclinq_md.md)] queries, we recommend that you use query syntax whenever possible and method syntax whenever necessary. There is no semantic or performance difference between the two different forms. Query expressions are often more readable than equivalent expressions written in method syntax.  
  
-   Some query operations, such as <xref:System.Linq.Enumerable.Count*> or <xref:System.Linq.Enumerable.Max*>, have no equivalent query expression clause and must therefore be expressed as a method call. Method syntax can be combined with query syntax in various ways. For more information, see [Query Syntax and Method Syntax in LINQ](../../../csharp\programming-guide\concepts\linq/query-syntax-and-method-syntax-in-linq.md).  
  
-   Query expressions can be compiled to expression trees or to delegates, depending on the type that the query is applied to. <xref:System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable`1> queries are compiled to delegates. <xref:System.Linq.IQueryable> and <xref:System.Linq.IQueryable`1> queries are compiled to expression trees. For more information, see [Expression Trees](../Topic/Expression%20Trees%20\(C%23%20and%20Visual%20Basic\).md).
