# How to: Group Results by Contiguous Keys (C# Programming Guide)
The following example shows how to group elements into chunks that represent subsequences of contiguous keys. For example, assume that you are given the following sequence of key-value pairs:  
  
|Key|Value|  
|---------|-----------|  
|A|We|  
|A|think|  
|A|that|  
|B|Linq|  
|C|is|  
|A|really|  
|B|cool|  
|B|!|  
  
 The following groups will be created in this order:  
  
1.  We, think, that  
  
2.  Linq  
  
3.  is  
  
4.  really  
  
5.  cool, !  
  
 The solution is implemented as an extension method that is thread-safe and that returns its results in a streaming manner. In other words, it produces its groups as it moves through the source sequence. Unlike the `group` or `orderby` operators, it can begin returning groups to the caller before all of the sequence has been read.  
  
 Thread-safety is accomplished by making a copy of each group or chunk as the source sequence is iterated, as explained in the source code comments. If the source sequence has a large sequence of contiguous items, the common language runtime may throw an <xref:System.OutOfMemoryException>.  
  
## Example  
 The following example shows both the extension method and the client code that uses it.  
  
 [!code-cs[cscsrefContiguousGroups#1](../../../csharp\programming-guide\linq-query-expressions/codesnippet/CSharp/how-to-group-results-by-contiguous-keys_1.cs)]  
  
 To use the extension method in your project, copy the `MyExtensions` static class to a new or existing source code file and if it is required, add a `using` directive for the namespace where it is located.
