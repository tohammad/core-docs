# How to: Write LINQ Queries in C#
This topic shows the three ways in which you can write a [!INCLUDE[vbteclinq](../../../csharp/includes/vbteclinq_md.md)] query in C#:  
  
1.  Use query syntax.  
  
2.  Use method syntax.  
  
3.  Use a combination of query syntax and method syntax.  
  
 The following examples demonstrate some simple [!INCLUDE[vbteclinq](../../../csharp/includes/vbteclinq_md.md)] queries by using each approach listed previously. In general, the rule is to use (1) whenever possible, and use (2) and (3) whenever necessary.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  These queries operate on simple in-memory collections; however, the basic syntax is identical to that used in [!INCLUDE[vbtecdlinq](../../../csharp/includes/vbtecdlinq_md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[sqltecxlinq](../../../csharp\programming-guide\concepts\linq/includes/sqltecxlinq_md.md)].  
  
## Example  
  
## Query Syntax  
 The recommended way to write most queries is to use *query syntax* to create *query expressions*. The following example shows three query expressions. The first query expression demonstrates how to filter or restrict results by applying conditions with a `where` clause. It returns all elements in the source sequence whose values are greater than 7 or less than 3. The second expression demonstrates how to order the returned results. The third expression demonstrates how to group results according to a key. This query returns two groups based on the first letter of the word.  
  
 [!code-cs[csProgGuideLINQ#5](../../../csharp\programming-guide\classes-and-structs/codesnippet/CSharp/how-to-write-linq-queries-in-csharp_1.cs)]  
  
 Note that the type of the queries is <xref:System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable`1>. All of these queries could be written using `var` as shown in the following example:  
  
 `var query = from num in numbers...`  
  
 In each previous example, the queries do not actually execute until you iterate over the query variable in a `foreach` statement. For more information, see [Introduction to LINQ Queries (C#)](../../../csharp\programming-guide\concepts\linq/introduction-to-linq-queries.md).  
  
## Example  
  
## Method Syntax  
 Some query operations must be expressed as a method call. The most common such methods are those that return singleton numeric values, such as <xref:System.Linq.Enumerable.Sum*>, <xref:System.Linq.Enumerable.Max*>, <xref:System.Linq.Enumerable.Min*>, <xref:System.Linq.Enumerable.Average*>, and so on. These methods must always be called last in any query because they represent only a single value and cannot serve as the source for an additional query operation. The following example shows a method call in a query expression:  
  
 [!code-cs[csProgGuideLINQ#6](../../../csharp\programming-guide\classes-and-structs/codesnippet/CSharp/how-to-write-linq-queries-in-csharp_2.cs)]  
  
## Example  
 If the method has parameters, these are provided in the form of a [lambda](../../../csharp\programming-guide\statements-expressions-operators/lambda-expressions.md) expression, as shown in the following example:  
  
 [!code-cs[csProgGuideLINQ#7](../../../csharp\programming-guide\classes-and-structs/codesnippet/CSharp/how-to-write-linq-queries-in-csharp_3.cs)]  
  
 In the previous queries, only Query #4 executes immediately. This is because it returns a single value, and not a generic <xref:System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable`1> collection. The method itself has to use `foreach` in order to compute its value.  
  
 Each of the previous queries can be written by using implicit typing with [var](../../../csharp\language-reference\keywords/var.md), as shown in the following example:  
  
 [!code-cs[csProgGuideLINQ#8](../../../csharp\programming-guide\classes-and-structs/codesnippet/CSharp/how-to-write-linq-queries-in-csharp_4.cs)]  
  
## Example  
  
## Mixed Query and Method Syntax  
 This example shows how to use method syntax on the results of a query clause. Just enclose the query expression in parentheses, and then apply the dot operator and call the method. In the following example, query #7 returns a count of the numbers whose value is between 3 and 7. In general, however, it is better to use a second variable to store the result of the method call. In this manner, the query is less likely to be confused with the results of the query.  
  
 [!code-cs[csProgGuideLINQ#9](../../../csharp\programming-guide\classes-and-structs/codesnippet/CSharp/how-to-write-linq-queries-in-csharp_5.cs)]  
  
 Because Query #7 returns a single value and not a collection, the query executes immediately.  
  
 The previous query can be written by using implicit typing with `var`, as follows:  
  
```  
var numCount = (from num in numbers...  
```  
  
 It can be written in method syntax as follows:  
  
```  
var numCount = numbers.Where(n => n < 3 || n > 7).Count();  
```  
  
 It can be written by using explicit typing, as follows:  
  
```  
int numCount = numbers.Where(n => n < 3 || n > 7).Count();  
```
