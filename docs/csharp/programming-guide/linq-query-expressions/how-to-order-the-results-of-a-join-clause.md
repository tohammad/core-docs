# How to: Order the Results of a Join Clause (C# Programming Guide)
This example shows how to order the results of a join operation. Note that the ordering is performed after the join. Although you can use an `orderby` clause with one or more of the source sequences before the join, generally we do not recommend it. Some [!INCLUDE[vbteclinq](../../../csharp/includes/vbteclinq_md.md)] providers might not preserve that ordering after the join.  
  
## Example  
 This query creates a group join, and then sorts the groups based on the category element, which is still in scope. Inside the anonymous type initializer, a sub-query orders all the matching elements from the products sequence.  
  
 [!code-cs[csProgGuideLINQ#81](../../../csharp\programming-guide\classes-and-structs/codesnippet/CSharp/how-to-order-the-results-of-a-join-clause_1.cs)]  
  
## Compiling the Code  
  
-   Create a [!INCLUDE[vs_current_short](../../../csharp\programming-guide\classes-and-structs/includes/vs_current_short_md.md)] project that targets the .NET Framework version 3.5. By default, the project has a reference to System.Core.dll and a `using` directive for the System.Linq namespace.  
  
-   Copy the code into your project.  
  
-   Press F5 to compile and run the program.  
  
-   Press any key to exit the console window.
