# How to: Perform a Subquery on a Grouping Operation (C# Programming Guide)
This topic shows two different ways to create a query that orders the source data into groups, and then performs a subquery over each group individually. The basic technique in each example is to group the source elements by using a *continuation* named `newGroup`, and then generating a new subquery against `newGroup`. This subquery is run against each new group that is created by the outer query. Note that in this particular example the final output is not a group, but a flat sequence of anonymous types.  
  
 For more information about how to group, see [group clause](../../../csharp\language-reference\keywords/group-clause.md).  
  
 For more information about continuations, see [into](../../../csharp\language-reference\keywords/into.md). The following example uses an in-memory data structure as the data source, but the same principles apply for any kind of [!INCLUDE[vbteclinq](../../../csharp/includes/vbteclinq_md.md)] data source.  
  
## Example  
 [!code-cs[csProgGuideLINQ#23](../../../csharp\programming-guide\classes-and-structs/codesnippet/CSharp/how-to-perform-a-subquery-on-a-grouping-operation_1.cs)]  
  
## Compiling the Code  
 This example contains references to objects that are defined in the sample application in [How to: Query a Collection of Objects](../../../csharp\programming-guide\linq-query-expressions/how-to-query-a-collection-of-objects.md). To compile and run this method, paste it into the `StudentClass` class in that application and add a call to it from the `Main` method.  
  
 When you adapt this method to your own application, remember that LINQ requires version 3.5 of the [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](../../../csharp\getting-started/includes/dnprdnshort_md.md)], and the project must contain a reference to System.Core.dll and a using directive for System.Linq. LINQ to SQL, LINQ to XML and LINQ to DataSet types require additional usings and references. For more information, see [How to: Create a LINQ Project](../Topic/How%20to:%20Create%20a%20LINQ%20Project.md).
