# How to: Store the Results of a Query in Memory (C# Programming Guide)
A query is basically a set of instructions for how to retrieve and organize data. To execute the query requires a call to its <xref:System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable`1.GetEnumerator*> method. This call is made when you use a `foreach` loop to iterate over the elements. To evaluate a query and store its results without executing a `foreach` loop, just call one of the following methods on the query variable:  
  
-   <xref:System.Linq.Enumerable.ToList*>  
  
-   <xref:System.Linq.Enumerable.ToArray*>  
  
-   <xref:System.Linq.Enumerable.ToDictionary*>  
  
-   <xref:System.Linq.Enumerable.ToLookup*>  
  
 We recommend that when you store the query results, you assign the returned collection object to a new variable as shown in the following example:  
  
## Example  
 [!code-cs[csProgGuideLINQ#25](../../../csharp\programming-guide\classes-and-structs/codesnippet/CSharp/how-to-store-the-results-of-a-query-in-memory_1.cs)]  
  
## Compiling the Code  
  
-   Create a [!INCLUDE[vs_current_short](../../../csharp\programming-guide\classes-and-structs/includes/vs_current_short_md.md)] project that targets the .NET Framework version 3.5. By default, the project has a reference to System.Core.dll and a `using` directive for the System.Linq namespace.  
  
-   Copy the code into your project.  
  
-   Press F5 to compile and run the program.  
  
-   Press any key to exit the console window.
