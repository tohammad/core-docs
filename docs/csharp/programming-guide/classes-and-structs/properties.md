# Properties (C# Programming Guide)
A property is a member that provides a flexible mechanism to read, write, or compute the value of a private field. Properties can be used as if they are public data members, but they are actually special methods called *accessors*. This enables data to be accessed easily and still helps promote the safety and flexibility of methods.  
  
 In this example, the `TimePeriod` class stores a time period. Internally the class stores the time in seconds, but a property named `Hours` enables a client to specify a time in hours. The accessors for the `Hours` property perform the conversion between hours and seconds.  
  
## Example  
 [!code-cs[csProgGuideProperties#1](../../../csharp\programming-guide\classes-and-structs/codesnippet/CSharp/properties_1.cs)]  
  
## Expression Body Definitions  
 It is common to have properties that simply return immediately with the result of an expression.  There is a syntax shortcut for defining these properties using `=>`:  
  
```c#  
public string Name => First + " " + Last;   
```  
  
 The property must be read only, and you do not use the `get` accessor keyword.  
  
## Properties Overview  
  
-   Properties enable a class to expose a public way of getting and setting values, while hiding implementation or verification code.  
  
-   A [get](../../../csharp\language-reference\keywords/get.md) property accessor is used to return the property value, and a [set](../../../csharp\language-reference\keywords/set.md) accessor is used to assign a new value. These accessors can have different access levels. For more information, see [Restricting Accessor Accessibility](../../../csharp\programming-guide\classes-and-structs/restricting-accessor-accessibility.md).  
  
-   The [value](../../../csharp\language-reference\keywords/value.md) keyword is used to define the value being assigned by the `set` accessor.  
  
-   Properties that do not implement a `set` accessor are read only.  
  
-   For simple properties that require no custom accessor code, consider the option of using auto-implemented properties. For more information, see [Auto-Implemented Properties](../../../csharp\programming-guide\classes-and-structs/auto-implemented-properties.md).
