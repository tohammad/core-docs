# Anonymous Functions (C# Programming Guide)
An anonymous function is an "inline" statement or expression that can be used wherever a delegate type is expected. You can use it to initialize a named delegate or pass it instead of a named delegate type as a method parameter.  
  
 There are two kinds of anonymous functions, which are discussed individually in the following topics:  
  
-   [Lambda Expressions](../../../csharp\programming-guide\statements-expressions-operators/lambda-expressions.md).  
  
-   [Anonymous Methods](../../../csharp\programming-guide\statements-expressions-operators/anonymous-methods.md)  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  Lambda expressions can be bound to expression trees and also to delegates.  
  
## The Evolution of Delegates in C#  
 In C# 1.0, you created an instance of a delegate by explicitly initializing it with a method that was defined elsewhere in the code. C# 2.0 introduced the concept of anonymous methods as a way to write unnamed inline statement blocks that can be executed in a delegate invocation. C# 3.0 introduced lambda expressions, which are similar in concept to anonymous methods but more expressive and concise. These two features are known collectively as *anonymous functions*. In general, applications that target version 3.5 and later of the [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](../../../csharp\getting-started/includes/dnprdnshort_md.md)] should use lambda expressions.  
  
 The following example demonstrates the evolution of delegate creation from C# 1.0 to C# 3.0:
