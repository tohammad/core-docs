# Indexers (C# Programming Guide)
Indexers allow instances of a class or struct to be indexed just like arrays. Indexers resemble [properties](../../../csharp\programming-guide\classes-and-structs/properties.md) except that their accessors take parameters.  
  
 In the following example, a generic class is defined and provided with simple [get](../../../csharp\language-reference\keywords/get.md) and [set](../../../csharp\language-reference\keywords/set.md) accessor methods as a means of assigning and retrieving values. The `Program` class creates an instance of this class for storing strings.

>  For more examples, see [Related Sections](../../../csharp\programming-guide\indexers/index.md#BKMK_RelatedSections).  
  
## Expression Body Definitions  
 It is common to have indexers that simply return immediately with the result of an expression.  There is a syntax shortcut for defining these indexers using `=>`:  
  
```c#  
public Customer this[long id] => store.LookupCustomer(id);  
```  
  
 The indexer must be read only, and you do not use the `get` accessor keyword.  
  
## Indexers Overview  
  
-   Indexers enable objects to be indexed in a similar manner to arrays.  
  
-   A `get` accessor returns a value. A `set` accessor assigns a value.  
  
-   The [this](../../../csharp\language-reference\keywords/this.md) keyword is used to define the indexers.  
  
-   The [value](../../../csharp\language-reference\keywords/value.md) keyword is used to define the value being assigned by the `set` indexer.  
  
-   Indexers do not have to be indexed by an integer value; it is up to you how to define the specific look-up mechanism.  
  
-   Indexers can be overloaded.  
  
-   Indexers can have more than one formal parameter, for example, when accessing a two-dimensional array.
