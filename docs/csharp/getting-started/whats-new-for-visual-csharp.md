 Current version, see below  
  
## Current Version  
 [nameof](../../csharp\language-reference\keywords/nameof.md)  
 You can get the unqualified string name of a type or member for use in an error message without hard coding a string.  This allows your code to remain correct when refactoring.  This feature is also useful for hooking up model-view-controller MVC links and firing property changed events.  
  
 [String Interpolation](../../csharp\language-reference\keywords/interpolated-strings.md)  
 You can use string interpolation expressions to construct strings.  An interpolated string expression looks like a template string that contains expressions.  C# creates a string by replacing the expressions with the ToString represenations of the expressions’ results.  An interpolated string is easier to understand with respect to arguments than [Composite Formatting](../Topic/Composite%20Formatting.md).  
  
 [Null-conditional Member Access and Indexing](../../csharp\language-reference\operators/null-conditional-operators.md)  
 You can test for null in a very light syntactic way before performing a member access (`?.`) or index (`?[]`) operation.  These operators help you write less code to handle null checks, especially for descending into data structures.  If the left operand or object reference is null, the operations returns null.  
  
 [Index Initializers](../../csharp\programming-guide\classes-and-structs/object-and-collection-initializers.md)  
 You can now initialize specific elements of a collection that supports indexing, such as initializing a dictionary.  
  
 [Collection Initializer and Add Extension Methods](../../csharp\programming-guide\classes-and-structs/object-and-collection-initializers.md)  
 You can use initializers for collections now when the collection has an Add Extension method.  Previously the Add method had to be an instance method.  
  
 **Overload Resolution**  
 The compiler has improved overload resolution that results in more code just working the way you would expect it to behave.  One place where you might stop noticing a problem is when choosing between overloads taking nullable value types, or when passing method groups (instead of lambdas) to overloads that take delegates.  
  
 [Exception Filters](../../csharp\language-reference\keywords/try-catch.md)  
 You can use exception filers in `catch` clauses to determine whether a catch clause should handle the exception.  Without this feature, you have to rethrow the exception, which clips the call stack reported in the rethrown exception.  
  
 [Await in Catch and Finally Blocks](../../csharp\language-reference\keywords/try-catch.md)  
 You can use `await` in `catch` and `finally` clauses.  
  
 [Auto-property Initializers](../../csharp\programming-guide\classes-and-structs/auto-implemented-properties.md)  
 You can initialize auto-properties now similarly to how you initialize fields.  
  
 [Getter-only Auto-properites](../../csharp\programming-guide\classes-and-structs/auto-implemented-properties.md)  
 You can define read-only auto-properties now without having to define a property with complete property syntax.  You can initialize the property where you declare it or in the type’s constructor.  
  
 **Function Members with Expression Bodies**  
 You can declare members with expression-bodies of code in the same lightweight syntax you use with lambda expressions.  See [Methods](../../csharp\programming-guide\classes-and-structs/methods.md), [Properties](../../csharp\programming-guide\classes-and-structs/properties.md), [Indexers](../../csharp\programming-guide\indexers/index.md), and [Overloadable Operators](../../csharp\programming-guide\statements-expressions-operators/overloadable-operators.md).  
  
 [Using Static](../../csharp\language-reference\keywords/using-directive.md)  
 You can import accessible static members of static types so that you can refer to the members without qualifying the access with the type’s name.
